	  <h4>Stage 1: Formation of planetesimal</h4>
	  <u>Description of Model:</u> 
	  <br>
	  Many different objects representing particles and other objects in space loosely floating around. These objects 	  vary in size and shape. 
	  <br><br>
	  <u>Informational Buttons on Model:</u>
        <ul>
            <li> <b>Asteroid Button</b> - Planetesimals are one of the building blocks of planets. The hypothesis that
                 Psyche could potentially be leftover core material from a planetesimal could lead scientists 
                 to be abe to investigate questions about Earth's core, including how it was formed.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Question Button</b> - How might Psyche have formed?
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Spacecraft Button</b> - The spacecraft is equpped with two Multispectral Imagers. These high 
                resolution cameras will capture images of the asteroid's surface at different wavelengths of 
                light. This, along with pictures of the topography of Psyche, will allow scientists to study 
                features that provide clues to Psyche's history. 
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <p>
	  <u>Trainsition Between Stages 1 and 2:</u>
	  <br>
	  The user is able to move the objects floating around to combine them into a singular object.
    </p>
    <br><br>
    <p>
	  <h4>Stage 2: Planetesimal</h4>
	  <u>Description of Model:</u> 
	  <br>
	  There is a singular object that is large to represent the combined particles. This is the planetesimal and
	  resembles a smaller, but similar, version of what a planet looks like.
	  <br><br>
	  <u>Informational Buttons on Model:</u>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Asteroid Button</b> - Scientists think Psyche may consist largely of metal from the core of a 
                planetesimal, one of the building blocks of the rocky planets in our solar system (Mercury, 
                Venus, Earth and Mars). Psyche is most likely a survivor of multiple violent hit-and-run 
                collisions with other material, common when the solar system was forming. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Question Button</b> - How will it be determined if Psyche is core material of a planetesimal?
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Spacecraft Button</b> - All of the instruments on the spacecraft will provide clues but, in 
                particular, the magnetometer will look for evidence of an ancient magnetic field: if Psyche 
                has a significant magnetic field still recorded in its solid body, it was once a core that 
                produced its own dynamo.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <br><br>
    <p>
        <u>Transition Between Stages 2 and 3:</u>
	  The user is able to move objects into the planetesimal representing asteroid strikes that, hypothetically,
        would lead to the planetesimal breaking up, leaving the core exposed.
    </p>
    <br><br>

    <p>
	  <h4>Stage 3: Core/Current asteroid</h4>
	  <u>Description of Model:</u> 
	  <br>
	  After being struck, there is a singular, oblong object. This is what may potentially be similar to the 
        current Psyche asteroid. 
	  <br><br>
	  <u>Informational Buttons on Model:</u>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Asteroid Button</b> - After numerous collisions, it is hypothesized that the potential planetesimal would
                have its rocky mantle stripped away, and leave behind the core material. This core material could 
                potentially be what makes up the current asteroid Psyche.
            </li>
		<li>
		    <b>Question Button</b> - What is it that planetary cores are made of?
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Spacecraft Button</b> - The satellite spacecraft contains a Gamma Ray and Neutron Spectrometer that will detect, measure, 
                and map Psyche's elemental composition. These measurements will be able to give scientists a better idea 
                of what exactly it is that potentially makes up the inner cores of planets.
